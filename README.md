# 🐷 Oink

*A workout motivation app powered by behavioral economics—because losing money stinks.*

## What is Oink?

Oink helps you build a consistent workout habit while earning a real fun-money budget.

Exercise daily to earn $5 toward your personal "guilt-free purchase" fund. Miss a day? Your balance **halves**.

Want that new guitar? Those fancy darts? A weekend trip? **Earn it by working out.** Your adorable pig companion gets stronger as your balance grows—and smaller when you skip.

### The Real Money Angle

**Important**: The money in Oink represents your *actual* fun-money budget.

This isn't virtual points—it's an **honor system budget tracker**:
- 💪 Work out consistently → Build real purchasing power
- 🎸 Want something non-essential? → Check your Oink balance
- 💰 Cash out when ready → Actually buy that thing you earned

Think of it like this: Every workout is worth $5 (can change value in settings) of real money you're allowing yourself to budget for non-essentials. The app keeps you honest about what you've earned.

### Any Workout Counts

Oink doesn't care if you ran a marathon or did 10 push-ups. **Consistency beats intensity.**

The goal is to exercise *with intention* every single day—whether that's:
- A full gym session
- A 15-minute walk
- Stretching and mobility work
- A quick yoga flow
- Playing ultimate frisbee with friends

What matters is showing up and moving your body deliberately. We're building a habit, not training for the Olympics. The halving mechanic keeps you honest—you decide what counts as exercise.

## How It Works

### The Rules

1. **Start at $0.00**
2. **Exercise today?**
   - ✅ Yes → Add $5.00 to your balance
   - ❌ No → Balance ÷ 2
3. **One check-in per day** (can't game the system)
4. **Watch your pig get swole** 💪
5. **Cash out when ready** → Actually buy that thing you earned! 🎉

### Streak Freezes ❄️

Life happens. Sick days, travel, emergencies—sometimes you legitimately can't work out.

**Streak Freezes** let you protect your streak when you miss a day:
- Cost **2× your workout reward** ($10 at default settings)
- Hold up to **2 freezes** at a time
- Use them retroactively when you miss a day

Freezes cost double because they should feel like insurance, not a loophole. You're paying "two workouts worth" to skip one—expensive enough to discourage abuse, cheap enough to save you from genuine emergencies.

The goal isn't to punish you for missing a workout. It's to keep you coming back.

### Example Journey
```
Day 1: Walk 20min → $5.00
Day 2: Gym session → $10.00
Day 3: Yoga → $15.00
Day 4: Skip (busy day) → $7.50 (÷2)
Day 5: Quick stretching → $12.50
Day 6: Ultimate frisbee → $17.50
Day 7: Cash out $10 for new video game → $7.50 remaining
```

The halving mechanic means:
- Missing one day hurts, but you can recover
- Long streaks become valuable to protect
- Spending your earned money is celebration time! 🎊

## The Psychology Behind It

### Loss Aversion

The core mechanic leverages **loss aversion**—the principle that losses feel roughly twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good[^1][^2]. When you miss a workout, you don't just fail to gain $5, you **lose half your balance**. Your brain fights harder to protect what you've earned than it would to build it in the first place.

This has been validated across 19 countries[^3] and is one of the most influential concepts in behavioral science.

### Why Gamification Works

Research shows gamification dramatically improves habit consistency:
- **60% boost** in commitment when progress is highly visible[^4]
- **3.6x more likely** to stay engaged long-term after maintaining a 7-day streak[^4]
- **3x more likely** to maintain habits with clear recovery mechanisms[^5]
- **42% more likely** to reach goals when actively tracking[^6]

### Inspired By

Oink combines proven patterns from successful habit apps:
- **Duolingo**: Streak mechanics and visible progress
- **Finch**: Pet-care metaphor that creates emotional investment[^7]
- **Habitica**: Gamified progression for routine tasks[^8]
- **StickK**: Financial commitment devices[^9]

But Oink has a unique twist: **you're building toward rewards (things you want to buy) while protecting against losses (the halving mechanic)**. Unlike penalty apps where you risk your own money upfront, you start at zero and earn your way up. Unlike virtual reward apps, your balance represents real purchasing power. It's loss aversion applied to *gains you've earned*, not money you started with.

## Design Principles

Every feature follows these psychology-backed guidelines:

1. **Positive Reinforcement** - Celebrate wins, frame recovery as achievable, no shame or guilt[^7]
2. **Visual Progress** - Pig's appearance reflects your commitment, animations create delight
3. **Recovery Friendly** - Halving hurts but you can always bounce back (3x better retention)[^5]
4. **Clear Feedback** - Always know what you'll gain (+$5) or lose (÷2) before checking in
5. **Honor System** - You commit to yourself; the app tracks, you manage the actual money

## Use Cases

What people are earning:
- 🎸 Musical instruments and gear
- 🎯 Hobby equipment (darts, board games, sports gear)
- 🍽️ Nice meals or special ingredients
- 📚 Books, courses, learning materials
- 🎮 Video games or entertainment

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **Architecture**: MVVM with ViewModels
- **Database**: Room (local storage)

## Why "Oink"?

The piggy bank is the universal symbol of saving money. Oink combines that metaphor with a character that grows stronger with you, plus the satisfaction of breaking it open when you cash out.

Plus, "Did you Oink today?" is way more fun than "Did you work out today?"

## Acknowledgments

Built with inspiration from behavioral economics research and proven gamification patterns. Special thanks to Kahneman & Tversky for prospect theory, and to the teams behind Duolingo, Finch, Habitica, and StickK for showing what works.

### Built with AI

This app was developed heavily using [Cursor](https://cursor.com) with Claude as the AI pair programmer. From architecture decisions to UI implementation to debugging widget update issues, entire codebase was a human-AI collaboration. The psychology-driven design principles, behavioral economics integration, and Kotlin/Compose implementation were all shaped through iterative AI-assisted development.
